$META Change my mind. Thereâ€™s hasnâ€™t been a more exciting founder-led company since Steve Jobs.
Itâ€™s a privilege to be able to get in at what is still such an attractive valuation given profit forecast. 
I was saying it $100 and Iâ€™ll say it at $600.

$SPY How well do you trade price action? 
 
I called for 420.76 even when price was well above 423 on Friday 
 
Price action clearly showed that Market Makers wanted it to go lower

$META ...In the future we will just all live in little cubicles, about 6 ft square. With food intravenously fed into us, waste pipes attached to our genitals. And will be fine as long as we have our meta quest headsets on... You know because no one can afford a house these days

Here's the result for LARGE cap stocks. This is the result of ONLY buying when H% is low.
I have timestamps + buy fills for everything. The result speaks for itself

I don't make 100s of trades, I only buy when I get a confirmation. 
Next, I'll trade $NFLX + $META + $SNAP + $UBER
Let's play a game. Guess which ticker this is.
This is the play from 10/18 from buying when H% is low. Got Buy Fills + Timestamps + Gain % for those who are skeptical.
Buying when H% was low was the perfect LEVEL for a reversal trade again

$PLTR tell  Elon  of  $tsla if  he  does  $3.4 billion  for  9.999%  stake,  then  he  will  get  a  seat  on  the  Palantir  Board  of  Directors!!! 
 
It  would  be  like  Elon  doing  a  Ron  Baron  and/or  Cathie  de  Tesla  $arkk !!!    Bezos  of  $amzn and/or  $META Mark  might  want  in  tooâ€¦have  it  all  go  to  outstanding shares!?!?!?    No  Berkshire  like  deals!!!

$SPY This economy will be even stronger when house prices come down some. We should see more money out of real estate and back into the big 7. As we know those companies stocks will at least triple in the next decade $NVDA $TSLA $META $IWM Bullish
